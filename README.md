## Client Information
This site is being made for a couple of dog owners. Their want to run a website from which they can have fun blogging about dog care and daily experiences from the perspective of their dog Kira.

They take great pride in their homemade dog food recipes and would like to provide a place for other dog owners to learn from them and build on their ideas. Furthermore they hope to get followers who will keep up to date with "Kira's" reviews of toys (as she is a heavy chewer), and parks around the city.

In the long term, they intend to create social media content of their very expressive dog and hope to make a little bit of money through donations from people who have signed up for regular updates and extra content.

This first version of this site will offer:
* A photo gallery
* A blog space
* A recipe page

They clients have decided that if they enjoy using it, they would like to expandit's capability.
