# CPNT260-a1 README

This webpage is for the Calgary based experimental jazz group, Midnight Zamboni.
The band is preparing to release their first album and will be launching a cross Canada tour, this site is to be the main hub of content as they document their tour in real time.
As such, this site will need to allow for quick uploads of images and concert footage, a blog space for the musicians,a place where fans are able to post their own content, and a way for fans to communicate with the band.
Their social media sites will also need to be connected to this webpage.
They aren't heavy social media users and want a system where they can upload their content to their website, and be able to automatically have their posts go to certain social media websites.

At this stage of development, a basic navigation template and landing page layout will be set up, I am waiting on further consultation with the artists and their media team to determine the rest of the website.
Some stock footage and their older concert footage will be used.
